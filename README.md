# DeepWeather

DeepWeather is a deep learning approach to improving weather forecasting accuracy by supplementing existing weather forecasts with a variety of satellite images.

The intuition behind DeepWeather is as follows: Since plants can influence the surrounding climate (e.g., through processes such as transpiration and evaporation), then using certain vegetation features as inputs to a neural network (given a numerical forecast as a prior) may result in more precise forecasts.

## Implementation

DeepWeather was implemented in PyTorch and is available in this repo as a Jupyter Notebook. In what follows, implementation specifics will be discussed.
